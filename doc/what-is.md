**What I Offer:**

We’re pleased to inform you that all necessary compliance checks for every invoice type have already been successfully completed. These include:

* **Standard-compliant:** All standard invoices have passed ZATCA’s compliance checks, meeting all their regulatory requirements.
* **Standard Credit Note-compliant:** Credit notes issued against standard invoices have been validated and comply with ZATCA’s regulations.
* **Standard Debit Note-compliant:** All debit notes issued for additional charges have been verified and are fully compliant with ZATCA.
* **Simplified-compliant:** Simplified invoices for smaller transactions have passed all compliance checks, as required by ZATCA.
* **Simplified Credit Note-compliant:** Credit notes for simplified invoices have also been verified and comply with all necessary standards.
* **Simplified Debit Note-compliant:** Debit notes for simplified invoices have passed all compliance checks and are fully compliant with ZATCA.

This means that all invoice types — from standard and simplified invoices to credit and debit notes — are fully compliant with ZATCA’s requirements.

**1. CSR and Private Key Generation**

Before we even begin sending invoices to ZATCA’s system, we need to establish trust between your business and ZATCA. This is done by generating a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**, which is a digital document that contains important information about your business and will be used to securely connect to ZATCA’s system.

**What is a CSR?**
The CSR is like a digital identity card for your business that proves it is authorized to generate invoices. It contains details such as your business name, VAT ID (if applicable), and the type of invoices you’ll be issuing. The CSR is essential for obtaining your official **Compliance CSID** from ZATCA.

**Private Key**
Along with the CSR, a **private key** is created. Think of the private key as a secret password only your system knows. This key is used to sign your invoices, ensuring that they are genuine and that no one can alter them once they are sent to ZATCA.

We have already successfully generated and submitted the CSR and private key to ZATCA, ensuring your system is ready for the next step.

**2. Compliance CSID Issuance**

Once your CSR and private key are in place, the next step is to apply for the **Compliance CSID**. This is a unique identifier issued by ZATCA to confirm that your invoicing system is compliant with their regulations.

**What is the Compliance CSID?**
The Compliance CSID is like an official “stamp of approval” from ZATCA. It confirms that your invoicing system has passed their initial checks and is allowed to send invoices through their platform. Without this CSID, your invoices would not be accepted by ZATCA.

**The Process of Getting the Compliance CSID**
After submitting your CSR to ZATCA’s system, we used your **One-Time Password (OTP)** (a security measure sent to your registered ZATCA account) to complete the request for the Compliance CSID. Once the CSID was issued, we securely stored the necessary **Binary Security Token** and **Secret Key** that will be used in future steps to interact with ZATCA’s system.

With the Compliance CSID now issued, your system is one step closer to full integration.

**3. Invoice Compliance Checks for All Invoice Types**

Before we can start generating and submitting real invoices to ZATCA, we need to verify that every type of invoice your business issues complies with ZATCA’s e-invoicing standards. This includes all possible invoice types that your business might use:

* **Standard Invoices**: The regular invoices you issue for transactions.
* **Simplified Invoices**: Simpler invoices typically used for small transactions, often issued to individuals.
* **Credit Notes**: Used to adjust or cancel previously issued invoices.
* **Debit Notes**: Used when an additional charge needs to be applied to a previously issued invoice.

**Why is this important?**
ZATCA requires all these invoice types to be checked for compliance before they can be sent through their system. This is a crucial step to ensure that your business adheres to the regulatory standards and that the data you send is accurate and secure.

**The Compliance Check Process**
We generated several sample invoices (standard, simplified, credit, and debit notes) that covered all potential types. These invoices were signed with your private key and submitted to ZATCA’s system for compliance verification. Each invoice was checked to ensure it met the requirements for fields such as:

* **Invoice ID**
* **Customer and Supplier Information**
* **Tax Details**
* **Invoice Totals**

**QR Code Generation**
Each invoice also needed a **QR code** that contains essential invoice details for easy verification. This QR code is a requirement for ZATCA and must be included in every invoice submitted to them.

**4. Production CSID Issuance**

Once all your invoices pass the compliance checks, the next step is to apply for the **Production CSID**. This is similar to the Compliance CSID but is required for submitting live invoices (actual business transactions).

**What is the Production CSID?**
The Production CSID is your final key to submitting real invoices through ZATCA’s platform. It is only issued after the Compliance CSID is successfully obtained, and your invoices have passed all compliance checks.

**How We Obtain the Production CSID**
Using the **Compliance Request ID** from the previous step, we requested the **Production CSID** from ZATCA. Once issued, we received the necessary credentials, including the **Binary Security Token** and **Secret**, which are used to access ZATCA’s live environment for submitting real invoices.

With the Production CSID now issued, your business is ready to start sending live invoices directly to ZATCA’s system.

**5. Invoice Signing and Submission for Clearance/Reporting**

The final step in the integration process is to generate and submit actual invoices to ZATCA for **clearance** and **reporting**.

* **Standard Invoices (Clearance):** These invoices need to be approved by ZATCA immediately. They are typically for larger transactions or when invoicing businesses.
* **Simplified Invoices (Reporting):** These invoices need to be reported to ZATCA within 24 hours of issuance but do not require immediate approval.

**How Invoices are Submitted**

* We use your **private key** and **production certificate** to sign each invoice, ensuring that it is valid and secure.
* Once signed, the invoices are sent to ZATCA’s system for clearance (for standard invoices) or reporting (for simplified invoices).
* The invoices are also equipped with a **QR code** containing essential details that ZATCA can quickly scan to verify the data.
